This is a very simple index page based off the project from the odin project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page

This is a fairly simple exercise in HTML + CSS. Im gunna do a bulldog theme to add a bit more character to it.

Page is all done and can be viewed here https://krissandrew.github.io/Odin-Project-Landing-Page/
